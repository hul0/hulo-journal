## 🗒️ Notes / Free Writing

Bruh today i was stuck at creating this custom domain `diary.hulobiral.online` because i did not know how to point a github pages website to a subdomain (I knew the CNAME but not the value of it ) . But thanks to ChatGPT , he told me to just add my github username ``hul0.github.io`` to the cname value . So i learned a new thing (Probably , next time it will be faster SIUUUUUU!!)
> This is why you should buy a domain , Just sacrifice a Biriyani and you're all set

So basically it was :  
```
name            type            value
diary           CNAME           hul0.github.io
```


Then i just started writing this . And im gonna learn the Python Sockets tomorrow (That domicile certificate ruined it)  
Now this is just the beginning . See you later .
> Please don't tell me you read all this :)  
I'm embarrassed (Maybe)
