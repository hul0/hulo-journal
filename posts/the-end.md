If i ever die  
There is nothing to wonder  
Because i never wanted to live in the first place  
> _"There is nothing special about being born. Not a thing. Most of the universe is just death. Nothing more. In this universe of ours the birth of a new life on some corner of our planet is nothing but a tiny, insignificant flash. Death is a normal thing. So why live ?"_

Atlast i had found a name , but there was no lomger anyone to call me by it. Such a shame, Because hulo , was such a wonderful name! :)
